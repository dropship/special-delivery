#### Dropship Pd Generative Music Engine
This is a complete generative music system that creates constantly evolving modern Dubstep music, using a range of algorithmic composition techniques.
##### Installation
The patch runs in [Pd-vanilla](http://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data), and any required externals are included. The externals (u_storechord, seq, midiparse etc.) have only been tested for Mac OS.  
To run, clone the repo and open ```_main.pd``` in the root directory.

##### How to use this patch
As with many things in algorithmic composition, implementations of a particular idea or way of doing something are very specific to their use-case. Therefore look at this patch more as a practical reference point for various techniques of generating melodies, harmonies and rhythms for popular music genres.  
Pause the auto-play of the arrangement in ```[pd ambient-structure]```, which makes it easier to inspect individual instruments without the track progressing automatically.
